## Acknowledgments

In this project I learned so much about cakground and positioning, I was able to add a background to a text, also I learned how to make collapsable hamburger menus, to give a color shade to background images, to make a container box with transparency, and the biggest acknowledgement for me was to make a border based on an image (as seen on the tickets website). The majority of the website is about transparencies .
